              Express is a simple and popular framework for building web
              applications and APIs using Node.js. Think of Express as a tool
              that makes it easier to create the backend of your web appâ€”the
              part that handles things like routing, managing data, and
              connecting to databases.

              So I learnt to code in 2023... with all these technologies built
              on top of javascript... full respect to those old school
              developers... I cant imagine how they built applications without
              using modern technologies like we have.. express is one of them...
              and prisma is one of them too!
